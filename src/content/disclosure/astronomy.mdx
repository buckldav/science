- The Astronomy High School Supplemental SEEd Standards explore the patterns, forces, relationships, and systems of matter and energy found in the Universe.
- Students develop models and investigate patterns observed on Earth and in the night sky of phenomena that affect life on Earth.
- Students ask questions and model objects in our solar system and design solutions to determine where and how humans could colonize off of our planet someday.
- Students build models and construct arguments for the life and death of stars predicting the final stage of stars based on their mass.
- Students develop models and explain the formation and characteristics of the Universe.
