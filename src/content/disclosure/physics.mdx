- The physics SEEd standards explore the foundational principles of physics including forces, energy, fields, and waves. Students analyze and interpret data to determine the cause and effect relationship between the net force of an object and its change in motion.
- Students develop and use models to illustrate that energy at all levels can be accounted for as a combination of energies associated with motion and relative positions of objects.
- Students use mathematics and computational thinking to support the claim that the total momentum of a system is conserved when there is no net force acting on a system.
- Students plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that an electric current causes a magnetic field and that a changing magnetic field causes an electric current.
- Students also engage in argument to support the assertion that electromagnetic radiation can be described either by a wave or a particle model.
- Additionally, students design and evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these areas.
