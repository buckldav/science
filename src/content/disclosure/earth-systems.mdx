title: Earth Systems ðŸŒ‹
description: 1.0 credits (full year), foundation science
fees: There is a class fee of $10 that should be paid at the front office. This fee covers any perishable lab materials used throughout the course for building models that assist our learning.
materials:
  [
    "Pencil or Pen",
    "Somewhere to keep papers from class (folder, binder, etc.)",
  ]
fieldWork:
  [
    {
      location: "Clark Planetarium",
      website: "https://slco.org/clark-planetarium/",
      fee: "$25 (bus, entry fee, food)",
      motivation: "Clark Planetarium features three floors of hands-on, interactive exhibits. The topics are Earth, Near Earth, and Beyond.",

- The Earth and space science SEEd Standards investigate processes and mechanisms that have resulted in the formation of our Earth, galaxy, and universe.
- Students develop models to illustrate the life span of the Sun and the role of nuclear fusion releasing energy in the Sunâ€™s core.
- Students analyze and interpret data to construct an explanation for Earthâ€™s 4.6 billion year history and explore changes to Earthâ€™s systems.
- Students develop and use a model of Earthâ€™s interior to describe the cycling of matter by thermal convection.
- Students plan and carry out an investigation on the properties of water to determine its effects on Earth materials.
- Students use computational thinking to explain sustainable and natural resources, focusing on responsible stewardship.
- Additionally, students design and evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these areas.
