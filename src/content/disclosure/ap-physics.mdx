- AP Physics 1 is an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course. Students cultivate their understanding of physics through classroom study, in-class activity, and hands-on, inquiry-based laboratory work as they explore concepts like systems, fields, force interactions, change, and conservation.
- Students have the option to take the AP Physics 1 (algebra-based) test at the end of the year ($99, 3 science college credits).
- Students will need an account on [https://apcentral.collegeboard.org](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org) for exam preparation and other tools, even if they do not plan on taking the AP exam.
