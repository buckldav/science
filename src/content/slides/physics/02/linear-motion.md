### Linear Motion

### How far?

**Distance** is the measurement of how far you're traveled.

Treasure Hunt lab: Total distance traveled from A to B to C to D etc...

---

### How far and what direction?

**Displacement** is the measurement of change in position and what direction.

Treasure Hunt lab: Final pos minus initial position, compass direction.

It's a vector!

---

### How fast?

**Speed** is a measurement of how fast something is moving. Change in distance over time: `$$ s = \frac{d} {t} $$`

---

### How fast and what direction?

**Velocity** is a measurement of how fast something is moving in a direction. Change in displacement over time: `$$ \Delta \vec v = \frac{\Delta \vec x} {\Delta t} $$`

`$$ \Delta \vec x = x_f - x_i $$`

(x final minus x initial)

It's a vector!

---

A change is represented with the Greek capital delta

`$$ \Delta $$`

---

### Instantaneous velocity

`$$ v = at $$`

Where `a` is acceleration.

---

### Acceleration is a change in velocity

`$$ \Delta \vec a = \frac{\Delta \vec v} {\Delta t} $$`

Units: `$$ \frac{m} {s^2} $$`

---

### Most of the time...

We'll simplify the notation of the equations.

`$$ v = \frac{x} {t} $$`

`$$ a = \frac{v} {t} $$`

---

### Acceleration due to gravity

`$$ g = 9.81 \frac{m} {s^2} $$`

Sometimes we round to 9.8 or even 10.

---

### Free fall equation

In this equation, `y` is the vertical displacement fallen.

`$$ y = \frac{1} {2} gt^2 $$`

---

### Free fall equation solve for time

`$$ t = \sqrt \frac{2y} {g} $$`

---

### Example problem:

A guy named Grapenuts falls 235 meters off a cliff in the Grand Canyon. How long (in seconds) until splat?
