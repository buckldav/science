### Energy Warm Up

_Recall: What is the unit for energy?_

_Equations will be on the board_

---

#### Approach

We're going to do a few practice problems together to warm up.'

1. Draw a picture
2. Identify givens and equations
3. Solve

---

Over the course of a song, Aiden applies 50 N of force to his violin bow for a total distance of 35 meters of bowing. How much work has Aiden done?

---

How much work does Isaac need to do to deadlift 200 kg, 0.7 meters off of the ground?

---

What is the gravitational potential energy of a 200 kg weight that is 0.7 meters off of the ground?

---

How much kinetic energy does a 1 kg peregrine falcon moving 60 m/s have?

---

Let's say the falcon is 35 meters off of the ground. How much gravitational potential energy does it have?

---

How much total energy does the falcon have?

---

The falcon dives without doing any work (no wing flapping). When it is 10 meters off of the ground...

1. What is its new gravitational potential energy?
2. What is its new velocity?

_Consider the conservation of energy, where_

`$$ E_i = E_f $$`
