## Nebular Hypothesis

---

### Background

Up to this point, we've discussed the following:

- Gravity's role in gathering material into structures.

- How the Sun (and other stars) work with the four fundamental forces all playing a role.

### Zooming Out to the Solar System

- Now, let's zoom out a little further and see how star systems (like our solar system) may have formed, with the Sun and planets getting created from the same solar nebula.

- This process is called the **nebular hypothesis**, and it is the leading theory that explains how star systems form.

### Key Ideas

<ul>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">A <b>Nebula</b> is a cloud of gas and dust in space.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">A <b>Protostar</b> is a baby star; a large, hot, collection of gas about to undergo fusion.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">An <b>Accretion Disk</b> is created as gas and dust orbit the center of mass of a young star system.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">A <b>Protoplanet</b> is a baby planetary object.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Heavier elements were left near the sun while lighter elements were pushed outward by heat and centrifugal force.</li>
</ul>
