#### 1/3 Detailed Steps of the S.M.

1. **Observation**: Begin by observing a phenomenon or a set of facts that lead to a question.
2. **Question**: Formulate a clear, concise question based on the observations.
3. **Research**: Gather background information to understand the context of the question.

---

#### 2/3 Testing the Hypothesis

- **Hypothesis**: Propose a tentative explanation or answer to the question.
- **Experiment**: Design and conduct an experiment to test the hypothesis.
- **Analysis**: Analyze the data collected during the experiment to draw conclusions.

---

#### 3/3 Conclusion and Communication

1. **Conclusion**: Determine whether the results support or refute the hypothesis.
2. **Communication**: Share the findings with the scientific community.
3. **Repetition**: Repeat the experiments to verify results and ensure accuracy.
