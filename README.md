[![SpringMicroHost Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-springmicrohost-4f70ce.svg)](https://springmicrohost.com)

This [Astro](https://astro.build/) project was generated with `@springmicro/cli` using the [Astro Starter Kit: Blog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog) template with some modifications.

```bash
npm i -g @springmicro/cli
springmicro init astro -n science
```

## Features

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for CSS classes and theming.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for plug-and-play React components.
- [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) for blogs, newsletters, whatever you'd like.

## Development

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) if you haven't already.

<details>
<summary>Why pnpm?</summary>
It's a preference of SpringMicroHost. It mostly boils down to faster install times and better dependency management. `@springmicro/cli` commands only support pnpm so far.
</details>

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Adding SpringMicro packages

```bash
springmicro add auth
```
